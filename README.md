### Python und Matlab Files zur Vorlesung EE303 "DSV auf FPGAs" im Master Electrical Engineering an der HochschuleMünchen

[Python and Matlab files accompanying the lecture "DSP on FPGAs" (Digital signal processing on FPGAs) at the University of Applied Sciences Munich]

Here, you find python snippets to demonstrate various aspects of digital signal processing. Don't expect too much "FPGA" in the code snippets, the focus is more on general digital signal processing with some fixpoint arithmetics. The chapters are labeled as following:

**1. LTI:** Linear Time-Invariant systems in the time domain

**2. LTF:** LTI systems in the Frequency domain

**3. DFT:** Discrete Fourier Transformation and FFT

**4. FIL:** Digital FILters and filter design

**5. FIX:** FIXpoint systems in the time domain: Quantization and word length effects 

**6. NOI:** Fixpoint systems in the frequency domain: Quantization NOIse

**7. SMP:** SaMPling, Analog-Digital Conversion and Downsampling

**8 INP:** Upsampling, INterPolation and Digital-Analog conversion

**9 SRC:** Sample Rate Conversion

## Get started
You can either download the zip-File containing the most up-to-date version of the files or (better) clone this repository. For doing this, you need to install a git client from [http://git-scm.com/]. 

Under windows, install [http://msysgit.github.io/]

A good introductory & interactive course is {Ry’s Git Tutorial}[http://rypress.com/tutorials/git/index].
