### Python Files zur Vorlesung EE303 "DSV auf FPGAs" im Master Electrical Engineering an der Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften München

[Python files accompanying the lecture "DSP on FPGAs" (Digital signal processing on FPGAs) at the University for Applied Sciences Munich]

Here, you find python snippets to demonstrate various aspects of digital signal processing. Don't expect too much "FPGA" in the code snippets, the focus is more on general digital signal processing with some fixpoint arithmetics.
