### Python und Matlab Files zur Vorlesung EE303 "DSV auf FPGAs" im Master Electrical Engineering an der Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften München

[Python and Matlab files accompanying the lecture "DSP on FPGAs" (Digital signal processing on FPGAs) at the University for Applied Sciences Munich]

Here, you find python snippets to demonstrate various aspects of digital signal processing. Don't expect too much "FPGA" in the code snippets, the focus is more on general digital signal processing with some fixpoint arithmetics. The chapters are labeled as following:

Kap. 1: LTI : Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems in the time domain

Kap. 2: LTF : LTI Systems in the frequency domain

Kap. 3: DFT : Discrete Fourier Transformation and FFT

Kap. 4: FIL : Digital filters and filter design

Kap. 5: FIX : Word-length effects and fixpoint systems in the time domain

Kap. 6: NOI : Word-length effects in the frequency domain: Quantization noise

Kap. 7: SMP : SaMPling, Analog-Digital-Wandlung and Downsampling

Kap. 8: INP : Upsampling, INterPolation and Digital-Analog Conversion

Kap. 9: SRC : Sample Rate Conversion
